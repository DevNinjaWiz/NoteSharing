# Project Summary
This project is built using Angular for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
The backend provides a simple API endpoint that serves data from a db.json file.

On the frontend, the application primarily using `NGRX Signal Store` and `HttpResource` for handling HTTP data loading.
`Angular Signals` are also used extensively for building reactive and efficient component designs.

## Objective
The objectives of this repository are to:
- Gain an understanding of how NgRx Signal Store and HttpResource work.
- Establish a basic file and folder structure for building custom components and styling using SCSS.
- Explore the experience of using coding agents—such as Gemini or Codex—to generate a project from scratch.
